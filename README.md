# Hop'Edia server
This is the server of Hop'Edia, it needs a huge clean-up, help welcome 🍻.

Latest versions of the trunk haven't been tested, tag v0.1.0 is actually used in production.
Don't consider any of these as stable.

## TODO
 - Split parts of the code into files
 - Write unit tests
 - Enforce security
 - Drink beer, of course
